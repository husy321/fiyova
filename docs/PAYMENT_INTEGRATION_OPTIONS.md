# Payment Integration Options for Custom Amount Credits

## Current Situation

✅ **What's Working:**
- Custom amount input ($1 - $10,000)
- Credits system (add, deduct, balance, transactions)
- Product purchases with credits
- Transaction history
- Development mode (credits add instantly for testing)

⚠️ **What's Not Working:**
- Whop doesn't support dynamic checkout sessions for custom amounts
- Need real payment processing before production

## Your 3 Best Options

---

## ✅ **Option 1: Stripe Integration (RECOMMENDED)**

**Best for:** Custom amounts, flexibility, ease of use

### Why Stripe?

- ✅ Fully supports custom amounts
- ✅ Easy integration (30 minutes)
- ✅ Excellent documentation

### Implementation Steps

Go to: https://stripe.com
- Create account (free)
- Get API keys from Dashboard

#### 2. Install Stripe

```bash
npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js
```

#### 3. Add Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

#### 4. Replace Payment Code

I can provide the complete Stripe implementation code.

**Time to implement:** ~30 minutes
**Cost:** 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
**Best for:** Production-ready custom amounts

## ✅ **Option 2: Fixed-Price Whop Plans**

**Best for:** If you want to stick with Whop

### How It Works

Instead of custom amounts, create fixed packages:

- $10 package → 1000 credits
- $25 package → 2500 credits
- $50 package → 5000 credits
- $100 package → 10000 credits

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Create Plans in Whop Dashboard

For each amount:
1. Go to Whop Dashboard
2. Create new product/plan
3. Set price ($10, $25, $50, $100)
4. Copy plan ID

#### 2. Update Code

Use the original package-based system I created (it's already in your codebase in earlier commits).

**Time to implement:** ~1 hour
**Cost:** Whop's fees
**Best for:** If you prefer Whop and don't need exact custom amounts

---

## ✅ **Option 3: Keep Development Mode**

**Best for:** Testing, demos, internal use

### How It Works

Current implementation:
- No real payment processing
- Credits add instantly
- Fully functional for testing

### When to Use

- ✅ Testing the UI/UX
- ✅ Demonstrating to stakeholders
- ✅ Internal testing
- ✅ MVP development
- ❌ NOT for production with real customers

**Time to implement:** 0 (already working!)
**Cost:** Free
**Best for:** Development, testing, demos

## 🔄 ngrok Setup (For Webhooks)

Now that you have your auth token:

```bash
# Add auth token (only need to do once)
ngrok config add-authtoken 33nIVALYfHIFhPFKZqPEgwBn8ex_76trfL5PKYDUNG4dTPmTy

# Start ngrok
ngrok http 3000
```

This gives you a public URL for webhook testing.
