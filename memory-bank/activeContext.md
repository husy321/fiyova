# Active Context: Dodo Payments Integration Complete

## Current Work Focus
The Dodo Payments integration has been fully implemented and is now operational. The system includes complete product management, customer creation, payment processing, and success page handling.

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)
1. **Enhanced Success Page**: Created comprehensive payment completion page with:
   - Visual status indicators (success/failed/pending icons)
   - Payment details display (ID, amount, currency)
   - Status-specific messaging
   - Action buttons for navigation
   - Error recovery options

2. **Redirect URL Configuration**: Updated payment creation to include query parameters:
   - `payment_id={payment_id}`
   - `status={status}`
   - `amount={amount}`
   - `currency={currency}`

3. **Complete Payment Flow**: End-to-end payment processing is now functional:
   - Product selection → Checkout → Payment → Success page

## Current System State
- ✅ **Products**: Dynamically fetched from Dodo Payments API
- ✅ **Customers**: Created automatically during checkout
- ✅ **Payments**: Full payment link generation and processing
- ✅ **Webhooks**: Configured for payment status updates
- ✅ **Success Page**: Comprehensive completion handling
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and retry options

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Verify complete payment flow in production
2. **Webhook Verification**: Ensure webhook signature validation works
3. **Error Monitoring**: Set up logging for payment failures
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor API response times

## Active Decisions
- Using Dodo Payments as the primary payment processor
- Server-side data fetching to avoid client-side API calls
- Environment-based configuration for different deployment stages
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Current Challenges
- None - all major integration work is complete
- System is ready for production testing

## Environment Configuration
- **API Key**: `u9MhyWORfeA3Odd4.zwZDxSW2y-k69FbYhixdmmrSg5OmBdGEYY_1dMqBbW6R_32d`
- **Mode**: Test environment
- **Redirect URL**: `http://localhost:3000/checkout/complete`
